# SimpleEncryption 🔐

A secure and user-friendly command-line tool for RSA encryption and decryption of messages. This project provides a simple interface for generating key pairs, encrypting messages, and decrypting them using asymmetric encryption.

## Features ✨

- 🔑 Generate RSA key pairs for secure communication
- 🔒 Encrypt messages using public/private keys
- 🔓 Decrypt messages using private keys
- 📁 Automatic file management for keys and messages
- 🎨 Colored terminal output for better user experience
- 🛡️ Secure key storage and message handling

## Requirements 📋

- Python 3.10 or higher
- Required Python packages:
  - cryptography
  - termcolor

## Installation 🚀

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/DHMorse/simpleEncryption
cd simpleEncryption
```

2. Install the required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage 💡

Run the program:
```bash
python src/main.py
```

The program provides an interactive menu with the following options:

1. **Generate Keys**: Create RSA key pairs for two users
   - Enter the names of both users
   - Keys will be saved in the `keys` directory

2. **Encrypt**: Encrypt a message using a selected key
   - Choose from available keys
   - Enter your message
   - Encrypted message will be saved in the `messages` directory

3. **Decrypt**: Decrypt a message using a private key
   - Choose from available keys
   - Select the encrypted message to decrypt
   - Decrypted message will be saved as a text file

4. **Exit**: Close the program

## Security 🔒

- Uses RSA-2048 encryption with OAEP padding
- SHA-256 for message digest
- Secure key storage in PEM format
- No hardcoded keys or sensitive data
